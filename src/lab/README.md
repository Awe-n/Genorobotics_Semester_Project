# README for src/lab/

## Overview

Welcome to the `src/lab/` folder of our codebase. This directory serves as a dedicated space for various data analysis scripts and pipeline experiments that are currently not in production. It includes both our trial efforts and experimental code that has not yet reached production readiness.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this folder is to:

- Store data analysis scripts and tools that are in developmental or experimental stages.
- Preserve pipeline experiments that have not been successful or are still being refined.
- Provide a repository of ideas and implementations that might be valuable for future use or reference.

## Contents

The `src/lab/` folder includes:

- **Data Analysis Scripts:** Scripts and notebooks used for analyzing data, which may be experimental or in the process of being refined.
- **Pipeline Trials:** Early versions or trial implementations of pipelines that have not made it into production. These may include approaches that were tested but did not succeed or are not yet fully developed.
- **Experimental Code:** Any code snippets, scripts, or applications that are in the experimental phase and not ready for production use.

## Usage

- **For Developers:** Feel free to explore this directory for ideas, inspiration, or to understand the developmental history of our pipelines.
- **For Data Analysts:** This folder can be a valuable resource for experimental analysis methods and scripts.
- **For Collaborators:** If you're looking to contribute or modify existing experiments, this is the place to start.

## Note

This folder is a dynamic space where code may not be fully documented or tested. Please use the contents with the understanding that they are part of ongoing development and may not represent the final quality or structure of our production code.

Thank you for visiting our `src/lab/` folder!
